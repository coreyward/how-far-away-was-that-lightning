## What is How Far Away Was That Lightning?

One stormy day not so long ago I was counting the seconds between the time the lightning
struck and the time I heard the thunder, then dividing by 5 to determine how far away in miles
the lightning was. Before long, a creeping suspicion that the distance I was getting was
inaccurate took hold and I headed for [Wolfram|Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/ "Computational Knowledge Engine").

It turned out that I wasn't too far off, and in a few hours of wondrous procrastination I threw together
this little project. It's a simple one-page-website that calculates the distance between you
and the menacing 10-120MV lightning strike you just saw, based on the number of seconds it took to hear
the thunder it caused.

The messages it gives are witty, and it needlessly bashes IE users. What more can you really ask for?

## Code

All of the code is in the `public` directory, and all of the javascript is in the aptly named `js/everything.js`
file. It's nothing special, but if you feel like adding a bit of cleverness to either the messages or the code,
do be my guest.
